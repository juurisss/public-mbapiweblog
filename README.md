## About
MBAPIWEBLOG is the only bot that displays stats. Utilizing the API, you can make Discord bots that lets you view leaderboards or check other users' stats. However, you can directly view the stats and leaderboard from the main page of the website. This is the only tool (atm) that offers this functionality.

## Features
- View stats directly from the website.
- Utilize the API for Discord bots and other applications.
- Safe and high-speed operations.
- View the past stats of a player.

## Installation
For Windows:
1. Open CMD or Terminal and execute `winget install Git.Git` to install Git or directly from [Git Releases](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/latest/).
2. Once Git is installed, execute this command to install NodeJS: `winget install OpenJS.NodeJS` or directly from [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest/node-v21.3.0-x64.msi) (Possibly outdated).
3. After installing these, execute the following commands:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/EjurisYY/public-mbapiweblog
    cd public-mbapiweblog
    npm i
    ```
4. Modify `config.js` as needed. You can open it with Notepad.
5. Run the bot by typing `node index.js`.

## Usage
If you're running this in localhost, you may open https://127.0.0.1/bw in your website to access the website. From there, you can view other players' stats (if they are in the database because /stat is broken atm) and the leaderboards.
